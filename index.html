        said to have inspired Debussy’s La Mer <i>(The Sea)</i> and Rilke’s Der Berg <i>(The Mountain)</i>, <br/>
        ensures its reputation as an icon of world art. <br/>
        Hokusai cleverly played with perspective to make Japan’s grandest mountain<br/>
         appear as a small triangular mound within the hollow of the cresting wave.<br/> 
         The artist became famous for his landscapes created using a palette of indigo <br/>
         and imported Prussian blue. </p>

<b><p style="font-size:18.5px; color: #48727c ;text-align: center;font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"> The Wave off Kanagawa, also called The Great Wave<br/>
     has became one of the most famous works of art <br/>
     in the world—and debatably the most iconic work of Japanese art.<br/>
      Initially, thousands of copies of this print were quickly produced and sold cheaply.<br/>
       Despite the fact that it was created at a time when Japanese trade was heavily restricted,</br>
       Hokusai’s print displays the influence of Dutch art, and proved to be inspirational for many,</br>
       artists working in Europe later in the nineteenth century.
